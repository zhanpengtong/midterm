## Overview
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1. It can be presented mathematically as:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

So the first few numbers in the Fibonacci series would be: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

There are many ways to implement the Fibonacci sequence using code, and each method is discussed in more detail below. However, for the implementation I used in this report, the table below represents Big-O values.
